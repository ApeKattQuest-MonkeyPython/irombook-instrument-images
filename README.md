# IROMBOOK Instrument Images

This is a repository to store the free instrument images made by IROMBOOK and available from their websites:
 * https://graphic.nobody.jp/
 * https://saisaibatake.ame-zaiku.com/gakki/
 * https://digitalstamp.suppa.jp/

The repository has been set up to organize the images and simplify their usage on the MusicBrainz database, but the illustrations themselves are free to use (see [COPYING](COPYING.md)). If you use any, please do credit IROMBOOK for the image, not MetaBrainz.
