# IROMBOOK Instrument Images

This is a repository to store the free instrument images made by IROMBOOK and available from [their website](https://graphic.nobody.jp/).

The repository has been set up to organize the images and simplify their usage on the MusicBrainz database, but the illustrations themselves are free to use (see [COPYING](COPYING.md)). If you use any, please do credit IROMBOOK for the image, not MetaBrainz.
